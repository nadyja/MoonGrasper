#Grab the Moon

App created during the NASA Space Apps Challenge Hackathon in response to the challenge Book it to the Moon:
<https://2016.spaceappschallenge.org/challenges/solar-system/book-it-to-the-moon/projects/moongrasper>

Using Augumented Reality it lets the user find the curent position of the moon and then "grab" it, to explore it to their hearts content in the form of a zoomable high resolution photo of the moon in the curent phase.
